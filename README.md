For this assignment I recieved mockup code for a website that needed some Javascript work done in order to have the website generate a password based on the users input. The HTML, CSS, and linking Javascript coding was given to me as the foundation for my assignment. From here I moved on to create the variables I new I would need in order to allow for the user to interact with the website and input the criteria for their password. I utilized the const formula declaration to create 5 global declarations, each including prompt/confirm windows that the user would interact with upon clicking the "Generate Password" button. From here, the input given within the 5 declarations would be returned to the const formulas. Which all had a variable equivalence in the formula which actually calculated the password output. Based on the boolean and numeric values recieved from the 5 declarations. The password generative formula would give each variable a value of either numbers, letters, or symbols to include in the password calculating process. From this point, the script would perform a basic loop sequence to randomly select characters, until the length of the specified password length was met. The collected characters would then be returned to the function that connects to the html code, and presents the password to the user. 

I admit, upon looking over the assignment, everything seemed a bit daunting, especially because the module itself didn't all soak in while I was making my way through it. However, I feel like despite that, I was able to dig my heels in and use online resources enough to learn what I needed in order to sctructure everything, and ultimately come up with the product that I have now. I learned a lot throughout this assignment, and I hope to continue adding to my knowledge base.
